# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

## Project Overview

BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has experienced a significant decline in revenue due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To recover and thrive in the post-pandemic market, BoomBikes aims to understand the demand dynamics for shared bikes. This project involves developing a predictive model to forecast bike demand based on various factors, enabling the company to strategize effectively and cater to future market needs.

## Problem Statement

BoomBikes needs to anticipate the demand for shared bikes after the COVID-19 lockdown ends. The goal is to identify significant variables that influence bike demand and understand how these variables affect overall usage. This information will help BoomBikes tailor their business strategies to maximize revenue and meet customer expectations.

## Business Goal

The primary objective is to create a robust model that predicts daily bike demand based on a set of independent variables. This model will assist BoomBikes' management in:
- Understanding the key factors driving bike demand.
- Quantifying the impact of these factors on bike usage.
- Formulating strategies to optimize bike availability and customer satisfaction.

## Data Description

The dataset provided includes daily records of bike demand and various influencing factors such as:
- Meteorological data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.)
- Seasonal and temporal factors (season, month, day of the week, holiday status)
- Social and economic factors (working day status, COVID-19 related restrictions)

## Modeling Approach

The project follows these key steps:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to identify trends, correlations, and outliers.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most significant variables for predicting bike demand.
4. **Model Development**: Building and training multiple regression models.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing model performance using metrics such as R-squared, RMSE, and MAE.
6. **Model Interpretation**: Analyzing model coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on bike demand.

## Expected Outcomes

- A validated predictive model that accurately forecasts bike demand based on the given features.
- Insights into the most influential factors affecting bike demand.
- Strategic recommendations for BoomBikes to align their operations with predicted demand patterns.

## Conclusion

This project aims to equip BoomBikes with the analytical tools and insights needed to navigate the post-pandemic market successfully. By understanding demand dynamics, BoomBikes can optimize their bike-sharing services, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately increase profitability.
